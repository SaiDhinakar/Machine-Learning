# Multiple Linear Regression Example with Plotting

This project demonstrates how to implement **Multiple Linear Regression** using Python and the **scikit-learn** library. The goal is to predict a target variable (`Salary`) based on multiple input features: **Years of Experience**, **Education Level**, and **Hours Worked Per Week**.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following key components:

- **Data Creation**: A synthetic dataset of employees, including their years of experience, education level, hours worked per week, and salary.
- **Model Training**: Using **scikit-learn** to build and train a Multiple Linear Regression model.
- **Predictions**: The model makes predictions based on the test data and for a new employee.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to check the accuracy of predictions.
- **Plotting**: Visualizes the relationships between the target variable and each feature using both **2D scatter plots** and a **3D surface plot**.

## Features

- Predict salary based on:
  - Years of experience
  - Education level
  - Hours worked per week
- Visualize the relationship between each feature and the salary using **Matplotlib**.
- Evaluate the model's performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
- Visualize the regression plane with a **3D surface plot** showing the impact of all features.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiple-linear-regression.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd multiple-linear-regression
```

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python multiple_linear_regression.py
```

This will execute the regression, print the predictions, and generate the plots.

## Code Overview

### Step 1: Dataset Creation

We generate a synthetic dataset of employees with the following columns:

- **Years of Experience**: Number of years an employee has worked in their field.
- **Education Level**: A numeric score representing the employee's education.
- **Hours Worked Per Week**: The number of hours the employee works per week.
- **Salary**: The employee's salary, which is the target variable.

### Step 2: Train the Model

We use **scikit-learn's LinearRegression()** to create and train the model. The model is trained using the features: **Years of Experience**, **Education Level**, and **Hours Worked Per Week**.

### Step 3: Prediction

Once the model is trained, we use it to predict the salary of employees in the test dataset. We also predict the salary for a new employee based on their features.

### Step 4: Model Evaluation

We evaluate the model by calculating the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** between the predicted salaries and the actual values in the test dataset.

### Step 5: Plotting

- **2D Plots**: We generate 2D scatter plots showing the relationship between each feature (Years of Experience, Education Level, Hours Worked) and the salary. A regression line is plotted to show how well the model fits the data.
- **3D Surface Plot**: A 3D plot is created to visualize how the three features interact and influence the predicted salary.

## Understanding Linear Regression

### What is Linear Regression?

**Linear Regression** is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors). The relationship is modeled as a linear equation:

\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_n X_n
\]

Where:
- \( Y \) is the dependent variable (target variable, e.g., salary).
- \( X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n \) are the independent variables (predictors, e.g., years of experience, education level).
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept (constant).
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_n \) are the coefficients, which represent the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable.

### Types of Linear Regression

1. **Simple Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable.
   
   The equation becomes:
   \[
   Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
   \]
   
2. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables (as we’ve done in this project).

   The equation is:
   \[
   Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_n X_n
   \]

### How Linear Regression Works

- **Fitting the Model**: Linear regression works by finding the best-fit line (or hyperplane, in the case of multiple regression) that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values. This is done using an optimization algorithm, typically **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**.
  
- **Prediction**: Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the target variable for new data points.

### Why Use Linear Regression?

- **Interpretability**: The coefficients (\( \beta_1, \beta_2, \dots \)) provide insights into how each feature affects the target variable.
- **Predictive Power**: It is widely used for predictions when the relationship between the target and predictors is approximately linear.

## Example of Predictions

For a new employee with:
- 6 years of experience
- Education level 8
- Works 50 hours per week

The model predicts their salary to be approximately **$68,500**.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of **Multiple Linear Regression** to model complex relationships between a target variable and multiple input features. By visualizing the data and predictions, we can gain insights into how different features influence the target and how well our model fits the data.

Feel free to experiment with the dataset or use your own data for further analysis!
