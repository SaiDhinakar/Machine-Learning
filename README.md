# Basic Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms using sample datasets. It is designed to help you understand and experiment with various ML techniques, including regression, classification, clustering, and more. Each algorithm is implemented in Python, and the code is structured for easy learning and experimentation.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Linear Regression**  
   A simple algorithm for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used for prediction tasks.

2. **Logistic Regression**  
   A classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome, often used for binary classification problems.

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   A non-parametric algorithm used for both classification and regression. It classifies data points based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.

4. **K-Means Clustering**  
   An unsupervised algorithm used for clustering data into k distinct groups. It works by partitioning data based on similarity.

5. **Classification Algorithms**  
   Various basic classification algorithms, including **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests**, which are used for categorizing data into predefined classes.

6. **Clustering Algorithms**  
   Algorithms for grouping data into clusters based on similarity, including **Hierarchical Clustering** and **DBSCAN**.

## Datasets

The repository uses several sample datasets to demonstrate the implementation and performance of these algorithms. These datasets are typically small and easy to understand, making them ideal for learning purposes.
