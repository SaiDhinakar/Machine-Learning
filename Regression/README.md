# **Regression Analysis: A Simple Guide**

Regression is a **supervised machine learning technique** used to model relationships between variables and make predictions. It estimates the value of a dependent variable (\(y\)) based on one or more independent variables (\(x\)).

## **1. Simple Linear Regression**

### **What is Simple Linear Regression?**
Simple linear regression models the relationship between:
- **One independent variable (\(x\))**
- **One dependent variable (\(y\))**

The relationship is modeled as a straight line:
\[
y = mx + b
\]
Where:
- \(y\): Predicted value  
- \(x\): Independent variable  
- \(m\): Slope of the line (rate of change)  
- \(b\): Intercept (value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\))

*The line minimizes the distance (error) between itself and the data points.*

## **2. Multiple Linear Regression**

### **What is Multiple Linear Regression?**
Multiple linear regression models the relationship between:
- **Two or more independent variables (\(x_1, x_2, \dots\))**
- **One dependent variable (\(y\))**

The model can be expressed as:
\[
y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \dots + b_nx_n
\]
Where:
- \(b_0\): Intercept  
- \(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n\): Coefficients for each independent variable

*Plane representing the relationship between three variables.*

## **3. Polynomial Regression**

### **What is Polynomial Regression?**
Polynomial regression models the relationship between variables as a curve, rather than a straight line. It fits a polynomial equation of degree \(n\):
\[
y = b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + \dots + b_nx^n
\]

### Why Use Polynomial Regression?
- Useful for modeling non-linear relationships.
- Degree of the polynomial (\(n\)) determines the curve's flexibility.

*Higher-degree polynomials can better fit complex data.*

## **Key Differences**

| Type of Regression   | Independent Variables | Relationship Modeled       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Simple Regression** | 1                     | Linear (straight line)      |
| **Multiple Regression** | 2+                   | Linear (multi-dimensional)  |
| **Polynomial Regression** | 1+                | Non-linear (curve)          |

## **Applications**
1. **Simple Regression:**
   - Predicting house prices based on square footage.
   - Estimating sales based on advertising spend.

2. **Multiple Regression:**
   - Predicting a car's fuel efficiency based on weight, horsepower, and engine size.
   - Forecasting revenue based on multiple marketing channels.

3. **Polynomial Regression:**
   - Modeling stock price trends.
   - Analyzing growth rates in biology or physics.
